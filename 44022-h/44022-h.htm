<p>
Etymology of words for Locks and Keys:&#8212;"Klu," the Greco-Italian base,
to lock (<span class="sc">Fick</span>), from the Sanskrit "Klu," to move
(<span class="sc">Benfey</span> and <span class="sc">Monier Williams</span>); "Klavi," key
(<span class="sc">Fick</span>); "κλϵὶς," Greek, a key; "κλϵὶστρον,"
Greek, a bolt or bar; "Claustrum," Latin, a lock, bar, or bolt;
"Claudo," Latin, to close or shut; "Clausum," Latin, an enclosed space;
"Clausura," Latin, a castle; "Clavis," Latin, a key; "Clavus," Latin, a
nail; "Clef," French, a key; "Clou," French, a nail; "Clo," Gaelic, a
nail, pin, or peg; "Clo," Irish, a nail or pin; "Glas," Irish, a lock;
"Clo," Welsh, a lock; "Clar," Bourguignon, a key; "Clau," French
provincial, a key; "Clav," old Spanish, a key; "Chiave," Italian, a
key; "Chave," Portuguese, a key; "Close," English, to shut. From the
same root, "Klu," to move, comes also "Sklu" (<span class="sc">Skeat</span>), from
which is derived the Teutonic "Slut," to shut, and from thence the
Dutch "Slot," a lock, and also a castle, from "Sluiten," to shut; old
Friesic "Slot," from "Sluta," to shut; Low German "Slot." Thus also the
English provincial word "Slot," a bolt; "Schloss," German, a lock, and
also a castle; "Schl&#252;ssel," German, a key. From the Latin "Sero," to
put, comes "Sera," Latin, a movable bar or bolt; "Serrure," French, a
lock; "Serratura," Italian, a lock. The French word "Verrou," a bolt;
Wallon "Verou" or "Ferou;" Bourguignon "Varullo;" Provincial "Verroth,"
"Berroth," and "Ferroth;" Portuguese "Ferrolho." The forms in "f"
appear to indicate a derivation from the Latin "ferrum," iron. The
English word "Lock" is derived from the Teutonic base, "Luck," to lock
(<span class="sc">Fick</span>); "Loc," Anglo-Saxon, a lock; "Lock," Friesic, a lock;
"Lukke," Danish, a lock; "Loca," Icelandic, a lock or latch, or the lid
of a chest; "Lock," Swedish, a lid; "Loke," Wallon; "Luycke," Flemish;
"Loquet," French, a catch. In Early English it was pronounced "loke"
(<span class="sc">Skeat</span>). The English word "Latch" is probably the same as the
Danish "Laas," a lock; "Las," Swedish, a lock; "Luchetto," Italian, a
latch. <span class="sc">Skeat</span> derives it from the Anglo-Saxon word "l&#339;ccan,"
to seize; in Early English it was pronounced "Lacche," and he suggests
the probability of its being derived from the Latin word "Laqueus," a
snare, but this is doubtful. "Hasp," English, is derived from the
Teutonic base, "Hapsa;" "Hæpsa," Anglo-Saxon; "Hespa," Icelandic;
"Haspe," Danish; "Haspe," Swedish; "Haspe," German. "Moraillon," the
French word for "hasp," is of uncertain origin, but <span class="sc">Littr&#233;</span>
supposes it to be derived from the provincial "Mor," a muzzle, probably
the French word "Mors," a bit; "Morsum," Latin, a bit or a little
piece; "Morsus," Latin, a bite, as well as the English "Muzzle" and
"Nozzle," are all derived from the same root. "Clef b&#233;narde," a key
that is not piped (for&#233;e) (<span class="sc">Hamilton</span> and <span class="sc">Legros</span>) or
furnished with grooves, and which can be opened from both sides, is
from "Bernard," which in old French signifies a fool, hence a "clef
bernarde" or "b&#233;narde" is an inferior kind of key (<span class="sc">Littr&#233;</span>).
The English word "Key" was derived from the Anglo-Saxon "Cæg" by the
change of "g" into "y;" old Friesic "Kai" and "Kei." The English word
"Bolt," which is now applied to the most primitive form of the
mechanism, and probably the one from which the others took their
origin, appears to have been obtained from the Anglo-Saxon word "Bolt,"
a catapult. Thus we have the Danish "Bolt," an iron pin; "Bout," Dutch,
a bolt or pin; "Bolz," German, and it appears to have been adopted from
its resemblance to the bolt or arrow used with the catapult.
<span class="sc">Crabb</span> ('Technical Dictionary of Arts and Sciences') thinks it
comes from the Latin "Pello," to drive, and the Greek "Ballo," to cast,
and that it has thus been applied to anything shooting, as a bolt of a
door, or a bird bolt, whilst <span class="sc">Skeat</span> supposes it to have been
named like "bolster" from its roundness.
</p>

<p>
The word "Padlock" is important in relation to our subject. This kind of
lock is especially suitable as a fastening for baskets and saddle bags;
being a hanging lock, less liable to injury from knocks than a fixed
lock, it is used in preference to this day for travelling purposes. The
word "Pad" is a provincial Norfolk word used for "Pannier" (<span
class="sc">Halliwell</span> and <span class="sc">Skeat</span>). It hangs
about all words relating to early modes of travelling, thus we have,
"Pad," a stuffed saddle for carrying a pannier on horseback; "Pad-nag,"
a road horse; "Pad," a thief on the high road; "Pad," Dutch, a path,
"Pæth," Anglo-Saxon, a path; "Pfad," German, a path, which latter
English word is also itself cognate with pad; "Pod," a bag carried on
horseback; "Pedlar," a travelling hawker. The word "Padlock" therefore
means "Road lock," and it is significant in relation to the way in which
padlocks of like form may have become distributed over wide areas in
early times. The French word "Cadenas," a padlock, comes from the Latin
"Catena," a chain, and the connection is obvious; "Catenaccio," Italian;
"Candado" and "Cadena," Spanish; "Cadenat," French provincial; Berry
"Chadaine," a cord; Picard "Cagne" and "Caine;" hence also the French
word "Cha&#238;ne," and the English "Chain."
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
We see from this, that, as is usual in like cases, the words have
followed lines of their own, and afford but little evidence of the
forms of the objects to which they have been applied, excepting in so
far that the common word "Klu" or "Clo" for lock and pin, and its
connection with the base "Klu," to move, implies that the earliest form
consisted of a movable bolt. But, in any case, whether we take the
Latin word "Sero", to put, or the Sanskrit "Klu," to move, as
independent origins of words for locks, we are carried back to a time
when it consisted of a simple bar or bolt put up or slipped through
staples to close a door. The passage in the 'Odyssey,' so often quoted
in relation to the construction of Greek door locks, does not in
reality throw much light upon the subject so long as it is unassisted
by archæological discoveries. It has been variously translated,<a href="#note1" name="noteref1"><small>[1]</small></a> and
we are left very much to conjecture for the forms of the most primitive
kinds of locks which preceded those of which the relics are to be found
in our collections of antiquities. It is noteworthy, however, that the
earliest vestiges of apparatus connected with door fastenings in metal,
that are discovered, consist of keys, which leads to the inference that
the locks themselves may have been made of wood, and have therefore
perished. But we have survivals of primitive wooden locks in use at the
present time in different countries, which show us, with great
probability, the uses to which the keys were put, and it is to these
that we must turn in any attempt to trace back the history of the
mechanism from the commencement. The process is one, the merits and
demerits of which have been too often discussed to need comment here.
In the absence of direct archæological evidence we have no alternative
but to avail ourselves of survivals as far as possible. The materials,
however, in the case of locks are so abundant that it will not be
necessary to tax our imagination unduly in order to fill in the links
that are found wanting.
</p>

<p>
Of the bar, whether of wood or iron, used for fastening up the door on
the inside, little need be said, nor are we at a loss for a
commencement in the common door bolt. Figs. 2 and 3, Plate I.,
represent the inside view and section of a wooden bolt now in use on
barns and outhouses at Gastein, in Austria, and like many of the
ordinary appliances which in most countries are now made of metal, it
is there constructed entirely of wood, and is such a bolt as might have
been used in the most primitive state of society. It is intended to
open from the outside, where the handle, consisting of a flat oblong
piece of wood (fig. 3, <i>a</i>, Plate I.), communicates, by means of a
neck of wood, with the bolt <i>b</i> on the inside, and when shoved
home to fasten the door, the neck moves along a slit in the door shown
by the dotted line, fig. 2, <i>c c</i>, Plate I. Such a bolt can of
course be opened by any one whether from within or without, and it has
the further insecurity of being liable to be forced open accidentally
by anything that might catch the handle, there being no fastening
within to keep it securely in its place when shut. The simplest
contrivance for remedying this latter defect would be to insert a peg
or pin into the bolt, which might be left hanging by a string fastened
to a staple when the door is open, and when bolted, inserted vertically
into a hole in the top of the bolt in front of the upright guide or
staple through which the bolt slides, as represented in figs. 4 and 5,
Plate I., and it could be got at from without through a hole in the
door. By this means the bolt would be kept securely in its place when
shut, but it would require two motions both in opening and shutting the
door.
</p>

<p>
Anything calculated to save time in a process of such ordinary
occurrence as the opening and shutting of a door would be speedily
adopted, and it would soon be found that by fixing the pin vertically
in a slide, so as to fall freely, and making the lower end smooth, so
as to slide along the upper surface of the bolt as the latter was drawn
back, it might easily be so contrived that when shut it should fall by
its own weight into the hole in the bolt, as represented in figs. 6, 7,
8, Plate I.; in the former of which it is shown open, and in fig. 7,
shut, with the pin down in the hole, so as to secure it from being
drawn back until the pin is raised, which might be done from the
outside by means of a hole in the door, through which the string might
be made to pass, as shown in the section, fig. 8. By this contrivance
the bolt would only require one motion to shut it securely, and it
might also be placed in the inside; but to open it again two motions
would be necessary as before.
</p>

<p>
Still, however, the fastening would be accessible to everyone, and in a
condition of society in which property must always have been insecure,
it would become a great desideratum to construct a bolt which could be
drawn back only by the use of a key, which the owner might carry about
with him, and thereby secure his goods and chattels whilst he himself
was absent in the fields, or in the hunting grounds. So necessary a
requirement of every day life must have forced itself upon the notice
of the greater part of mankind, and it is not surprising, therefore, to
find that this stage of the development of the lock forms the point of
trifurcation of three separate branches of improvement. Two of these
are of the nature of tumbler locks, and consist of apparatus for
raising the pin or pins by which the bolt is secured when they fall
into the holes provided for them on the upper surface of it. It was for
this reason that they were termed <i>tumblers</i>, because they tumble
into the holes when the lock is closed. The third branch led off in
another direction.
</p>

<p>
In order that the mind may not wander from the lines of continuity
whilst I treat each of these three branches separately, I shall class
them as A, B, and C in the diagrams, at the same time allowing the
numbers of the figures to run on continuously from this point of
departure. By this means I shall be best able to show the ramifications
into which this mechanism, like all similar contrivances to which these
papers relate, separate as they increase in complexity.
</p>

<p>
The common door bolt (figs. 2 and 3, Plate I.) having continued to be
available as an inside fastening, in addition to more complex
contrivances for securing doors, has continued to be universally
employed up to the present time, and may be compared in nature to those
fossil species, which, having never become unsuited to their
environment, have survived throughout successive geological periods,
whilst the forms represented in figs. 4 to 8, Plate I., being
makeshifts, have disappeared as soon as they were superseded, and thus
they constitute the "missing links" of our developmental series.
</p>

<p>
The two great desiderata in the stage of the lock that we are now
considering were security and rapidity, both of which must have forced
themselves on the notice of the primeval householder each time he
crossed the threshold of his door. I shall begin with branch A in which
security only appears to have been aimed at, and then proceed to those
in which security and rapidity were combined. The first idea which
suggested itself was to put a bolt in a box, so that no one could get
at it to lift the tumbler without a key especially adapted to enter the
box and raise it, but as long as only one tumbler was used it must have
been very easy to pick such a lock by raising the tumbler with any
sharp-pointed instrument that might be introduced into the hole. By
using two tumblers, it would be impossible to raise them both at once,
except by a key constructed with projections or teeth to fit into
notches or holes in the tumblers, which teeth must necessarily be at
the same distance apart as the notches, and as the tumblers were hidden
in the box, no one unacquainted with the contrivance could make a key
to fit the lock, which by this means afforded to some extent the
security that was requisite.
</p>

<p>
Scandinavia appears to have been the headquarters of this class of
locks, or at any rate the part of the world in which they have chiefly
survived at the present time; one of the simplest of which is
represented in figs. 9<span class="smc">A</span>, 10<span
class="smc">A</span>, and 11<span class="smc">A</span>, Plate I., from
the Faroe Islands. <i>e</i> is the wooden block into which is cut a
horizontal groove for the bolt <i>a</i>, and two vertical grooves in
which the pins or tumblers, <i>d d</i>, play, and when the bolt is shut
to, they fall of their own accord into the holes <i>f f</i>. The key,
<i>c</i>, is passed horizontally into another groove cut for it in the
block, above and parallel to the one for the bolt. Two notches are cut
in the tumblers to enable the key to pass, and when pressed in
horizontally as far as it will go, the teeth of the key, <i>b b</i>,
coincide exactly with the notches in the tumblers, so that when the key
is afterwards raised vertically, it raises the tumblers, by means of the
notches, out of the holes, <i>f f</i>, on the upper surface of the bolt,
and the bolt can then be drawn out by the hand. It will be seen that
this lock requires as many motions as the bolt (figs. 6, 7, and 8, Plate
I.). It requires only one motion to shut it, when the two tumblers fall
into the holes and keep it fast, but to open it, it is necessary to use
both hands, one to raise the key and the other to draw out the bolt. It
may therefore be termed for distinction a hand-drawn lock. No time is
saved by this process, but the lock, for such we must now begin to call
it rather than bolt, is rendered more secure. Different kinds of these
locks, but all on the same principle, are in use in out of the way parts
of Scotland. Figs. 12<span class="smc">A</span> to 17<span
class="smc">A</span>, Plate I., similar to the last but having a slight
difference in the shape of the notches, is a Scotch wooden lock in the
Patent Museum at South Kensington, a facsimile of which is in my
collection. Figs. 18<span class="smc">A</span> to 22<span
class="smc">A</span>, Plate II., is another, also in the Patent Museum,
in which three tumblers instead of two are raised by the same key, as
shown in the sections, figs. 21<span class="smc">A</span> and 22<span
class="smc">A</span>, Plate II. Mr. <span class="sc">Romilly
Allen</span>, who has written a paper on Scotch tumbler locks in the 2nd
volume, New Series, of the 'Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland,' figures several others of the same class. One from North
Ronaldsay has four tumblers in line; another from the Faroe Islands has
three tumblers in line; another from Snizort, in Skye, has six tumblers
working independently of each other but raised with the same key, and
consists simply of two ordinary locks put face to face with the bolt
between them; another from Harris is still more complicated in its
construction, and is formed by five tumblers in line with two holes
running through the whole of them, and the key has two limbs, one for
each line of holes.
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary for my present purpose to describe all these locks in
detail. Though varying in character they are all constructed on one
principle. As with the more complicated contrivances in metal,
hereafter noticed, variety is an element of security, the greater the
variety, the greater the difficulty of making a key which will fit them
all; and this is another point in which the processes of the arts
resemble the processes of nature, variety adapts the mechanism to a
wider sphere of utility, and by encouraging change, promotes
improvement. In the one, as in the other, variation is a necessary
element of progress.
</p>

<p>
I see no reason to suppose that this class of locks was confined to
Scotland or to Scandinavia. They may probably have existed in other
parts of Europe, where, being made entirely of wood, they have long
since decayed, and their representations may have survived only on the
outskirts of civilisation. The law of geographical distribution is
inexorable&#8212;nothing can make the North of Scotland or of Norway or
the West of Ireland centres of the arts, and it is to such places we
must look for the survival of primitive contrivances. A precisely
similar key to those here described, but of iron, was found with Roman
remains near Gloucester, and is figured in <span
class="sc">Lysons's</span> 'Magna Britannia,' vol. ii., Plate 11,
showing that a wooden lock of this kind must have been in use in England
at that time. Figs. 23<span class="smc">A</span> to 25<span
class="smc">A</span>, Plate II., is a similar lock used in Norway, and
copied by me from a specimen in the Hazilius Museum at Stockholm.<a href="#note2" name="noteref2"><small>[2]</small></a>
Figs. 26 to 28<span class="smc">A</span>, Plate II., is another in the
Museum at Kew Gardens, copied by permission of Sir <span
class="sc">Joseph Hooker</span>; it was made by the negroes in Jamaica.
Figs. 29<span class="smc">A</span> to 31<span class="smc">A</span>,
Plate II., is a similar one from British Guiana, in the <span
class="sc">Christy</span> Collection. One is tempted by the presence of
these locks in the West Indies to suppose that they may have been
carried by the negroes from their African homes, and the resemblance
commonly attributed to them to the Egyptian wooden lock, constructed on
nearly the same principle, might lead to the inference that they may
have passed in that way to the West Indies; but it will be seen
hereafter that they differ in detail from the Egyptian pin-locks. They
are of the Scotch or Scandinavian type, and in all probability were
imported into the New World by Scotchmen rather than negroes.
</p>

<p>
It is now necessary to return to figs. 6 and 7, Plate I., which
represent the bolt with the single pin or tumbler, in order to trace the
origin and development of Class B. Whilst in Scandinavia and the north
of Europe, the key was applied to the upper part of the tumblers, above
the bolt, as shown in the preceding examples of the hand-drawn lock; in
Egypt, Asia, and probably in parts of Europe also, another system
combining rapidity with security was introduced. A key with a single
tooth was inserted beneath the bolt, and by raising the tooth vertically
and applying it to the lower end of the tumbler, the latter was pressed
out of the hole and raised clear of the bolt, and the tooth occupying
its place in the hole, the key itself was made to hook back the bolt, so
that the whole operation was performed with one hand holding the key.
Fig. 9<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate II., represents this kind of
lock, which may be termed a key-drawn, as distinct from a hand-drawn
lock. As with the tumbler locks of the north of Europe so with the
southern variety, security was obtained by multiplying the number of
tumblers and varying their position. Figs. 10 to 12<span
class="smc">B</span>, Plate II., are drawings of a wooden pin-lock and
key obtained by myself in Egypt, which is of the kind habitually in use
there at the present time. It has two tumblers in line. In fig. 10<span
class="smc">B</span> the lock is represented with the key, A, in it and
the tumblers raised, preparatory to drawing the bolt B. Fig. 11<span
class="smc">B</span> is the key, and in fig. 12<span
class="smc">B</span> the lock is shown shut, with the tumblers down and
the key lowered preparatory to withdrawing it from the lock. Mr. <span
class="sc">Romilly Allen</span>, in the paper already referred to, gives
an illustration of one precisely similar which he obtained in Persia.
Figs. 13<span class="smc">B</span> and 14<span class="smc">B</span>,
Plate III., shows an exactly similar lock in the India Museum, obtained
by Sir <span class="sc">Douglas Forsyth</span> at Yarkand, a facsimile
of which is in my collection. This kind of lock is also used in Turkey;
their identity throughout the region here spoken of is such as to leave
no doubt of their having been copied from one another, and indicates the
area of their distribution, about which something will be said further
on.
</p>

<p>
It appears doubtful whether or not this pin-lock was known to the
ancient Egyptians. <span class="sc">Rhind</span><a href="#note3" name="noteref3"><small>[3]</small></a> states that he
discovered one on a door in the interior of an ancient Egyptian tomb,
but its date, from the description given in the text, appears doubtful.
The tomb had certainly been opened in Roman times, if not later. <span
class="sc">Denon</span> also says that he saw one sculptured in the
Temple of Carnac, but he took no drawing of it, and the evidence of the
existence of this kind of lock in ancient Egyptian times certainly
requires confirmation.<a href="#note4" name="noteref4"><small>[4]</small></a> Sir <span class="sc">Gardner Wilkinson</span>
is of opinion that the earliest example of a key with pins such as might
be used with the pin-lock, is of the Roman period, in the reign of <span
class="sc">Trajan</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 90, and the
earliest known mention of any key at all is in the third chapter of
Judges, viz., 1336 <span class="smc">B.C.</span><a href="#note5" name="noteref5"><small>[5]</small></a> If the pin-lock was
in use in ancient Egypt it was certainly exceptional, as all the
sculptures represent the doors as being fastened by simple bolts.
</p>

<p>
Whether the modern Egyptian lock is a survival of an ancient Egyptian
form, or whether it is of Roman origin, it is certain, from the relics
of Roman bronze and iron keys and bolts found in various parts of
Europe, that the Roman lock was constructed on the same principle. Figs.
15<span class="smc">B</span> to 20<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate
III., may be taken as illustrations of the Roman lock when put together.
It is a reproduction from original fragments preserved in the Museum at
Mainz. Fig. 20<span class="smc">B</span> is the bronze key; it has four
teeth which, besides being at variable distances apart, are also of
different forms, some being triangular and others square. Fig. 19<span
class="smc">B</span> is the bronze bolt, made with apertures to fit the
key, and also to admit of similarly formed tumblers, shown in fig.
18<span class="smc">B</span>. The way in which these are put together is
represented in the section of the lock, figs. 16<span
class="smc">B</span> and 17<span class="smc">B</span>. The key <i>a</i>
is put into the keyhole <i>d</i>, fig. 15<span class="smc">B</span>,
with the bar of the key containing the teeth in a vertical position, as
represented by the dotted line <i>a</i>, fig. 16<span
class="smc">B</span>. It is then turned round, and the teeth brought up
beneath the bolt <i>b</i>. When pressed up vertically, the tumblers are
driven up out of the bolt, and replaced by the teeth of the key, which
hold the bolt so that it can be forced back by moving the key to the
right. When the bolt is withdrawn, it releases the hasp <i>e</i>, fig.
15<span class="smc">B</span>. Of such hasps, fig. 21<span
class="smc">B</span> is a drawing of an original in my collection, found
at Hetternheim. By reference to fig. 16<span class="smc">B</span>, it
will be seen that the tumblers, <i>f f</i>, are vertical, and would
therefore fall into their places in the bolt, like those of the Egyptian
and Scandinavian specimens; but being so small, and being probably made
of wood, their weight would be insufficient to secure certainty of
action, if dependent on weight alone; they are therefore pressed down by
a flat plate <i>h</i>, figs. 16<span class="smc">B</span> and 17<span
class="smc">B</span>, acting under the influence of a spring <i>g</i>,
figs. 16<span class="smc">B</span> and 17<span class="smc">B</span>.
This is an important addition, for it is evident that as soon as the
spring comes into use, the tumblers can easily be made to press into the
bolt horizontally, by means of a spring at the side, thereby enabling
the lock to be used in any position in which it may be required; and
there seems to be little doubt that some of the bolts and tumblers were
so constructed in Roman locks. The existence of a spring in Roman locks
is determined by the discovery of one with the spring in it, which is
figured in <span class="sc">M. Liger's</span> work 'La Ferronnerie.'<a href="#note6" name="noteref6"><small>[6]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The teeth of the key of the Roman lock described above, it will be
seen, are made to fit exactly the holes in the bolt; and this may
perhaps have served to give the first idea of the ward system, which
was so greatly depended upon for security in later times; but the same
fallacy attaches to the use of these fitting teeth which attached to
the ward system generally, for it is evident that any form of tooth
small enough to go into the holes, and of the proper length, would have
sufficed to lift the tumblers and draw the bolt; and accordingly we
find that, in the Roman key usually discovered, the teeth are merely
round pins, and have no particular form given to them for fitting
purposes.
</p>

<p>
The distribution of this class of lock may be determined by the
localities in which the keys and bolts have been found. Fig. 22<span
class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., is a bronze bolt of this description
in my collection, from Oppenheim, and obtained by me at Mayence. Fig.
23<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., is another of bronze, also in
my collection, from Heddernheim. Similar ones have been found repeatedly
in France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and England. The keys with teeth
are even more widely distributed, and have been found in all those
countries which have been occupied by the Romans. Fig. 24<span
class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., is a large iron key of this
description in my collection, found in the Rhine, at Mayence. The
earliest known example of a key with teeth, according to <span
class="sc">M. Liger</span>, is one represented on a coin of the <span
class="sc">Papia</span> family, dating about the end of the 2nd century
<span class="smc">B.C.</span><a href="#note7" name="noteref7"><small>[7]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
But the ward system appears to have developed itself still further in
connection with these locks and before the revolving key was introduced.
Fig. 25<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., is a specimen of a class
of keys frequently discovered with Roman remains, in which a plate is
attached at right angles to the pins. This plate is pierced with slits
of various forms, apparently intended to admit of the passage of wards
placed vertically beneath the bolt to prevent any but the proper key
from rising to lift the tumblers. The direction in which these keys were
raised is shown by the flat part of the handle of the key being always
at right angles to the pins and in the same plane as the ward plate.
</p>

<p>
Besides the bolts with several tumbler holes in them, others adapted for
single tumblers have been discovered. Of these fig. 26<span
class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., drawn from <span class="sc">M.
Liger's</span> work, and found in the forest of Compi&#232;gne, is an
example, and fig. 27<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., from the
same work, and found at Nonfous, in Switzerland (Bonstetten) is a key
adapted to fit such a bolt.
</p>

<p>
Other iron keys are found in England and France, the application of
which is more doubtful. They are found chiefly in connection with Celtic
remains, and by some have been supposed to be keys for opening doors
fastened with a simple latch on the inside.<a href="#note8" name="noteref8"><small>[8]</small></a> Such latches were
certainly employed amongst the earliest systems of door-fastenings, and
the keys in question might have served the purpose of opening them, but
they might also have been used to open locks with a single wooden
tumbler; the simpler kinds resemble somewhat our modern pick-locks, of
which fig. 28<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., is a specimen. Fig.
29<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., in my collection is from a
Germano-Roman tomb near Niderolm, and was obtained at Mayence; its
possible use, in the manner represented in fig. 9<span
class="smc">B</span>, Plate II., is obvious. Figs. 30<span
class="smc">B</span> and 31<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., are
two Anglo-Saxon keys found at Sarr, in Kent.<a href="#note9" name="noteref9"><small>[9]</small></a> Figs. 32<span
class="smc">B</span>, 33<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III., are two
keys of the Iron Age from Bornholm, in the Baltic,<a href="#note10" name="noteref10"><small>[10]</small></a> attributed by
<span class="sc">M. Videl</span> to the 3rd or 4th century of our era.
Fig. 34<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate IV., is a somewhat similar one
from Caerwent, in Wales.<a href="#note11" name="noteref11"><small>[11]</small></a> It has a flat handle and appears to be
adapted to be pressed downwards as if for opening a latch. Figs. 35<span
class="smc">B</span>, 36<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate IV., are
nearly similar ones, and were discovered in the Roman Villa at Hartlip,
in Kent.<a href="#note12" name="noteref12"><small>[12]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Figs. 37<span class="smc">B</span> and 38<span class="smc">B</span>,
Plate IV., are from drawings taken by me in the Mus&#233;e de Saint
Germain, and were found at St. Pierre-en-Chastre, Oise; others are
figured in <span class="sc">M. Liger's</span> 'La Ferronnerie.'<a href="#note13" name="noteref13"><small>[13]</small></a> Fig.
39<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate IV., is in the British Museum, and
was found within the entrenchments at Spettisbury, near Blandford; it
was presented to the Museum by Mr. <span class="sc">J. Y.
Akerman</span>. Figs. 40<span class="smc">B</span> and 41<span
class="smc">B</span>, Plate IV., are two found by me in pits in the
interior of Mount Caburn Camp, near Lewes.<a href="#note14" name="noteref14"><small>[14]</small></a> Fig. 41<span
class="smc">B</span> is of large size, 8 inches in length, and
sickle-shaped. All the objects discovered in this camp proved it to be
of the late Celtic period; the tin coins found associated with these
remains, the bone combs, pottery, and other objects belong to an age
anterior to the Roman conquest. Fig. 42<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate
IV., is a similar one found by Mr. <span class="sc">Park Harrison</span>
in similar pits in the neighbouring camp of Cissbury,<a href="#note15" name="noteref15"><small>[15]</small></a> in Sussex,
which has been shown to have been occupied by people of the same age as
Mount Caburn, viz.: the late Celtic period. It will be seen that some of
these keys, all of which are of iron, have a small return or pin at the
end, which is adapted to fit into a hole, and in the Cissbury specimen
this end is flattened, as if to enable it to fit an aperture of special
dimensions.
</p>

<p>
But for whatever purpose these crooked keys were used, whether as
latch-keys, as keys for single-tumbler pins, or as hooks to pull back a
plain iron or wooden bolt, the large size of some of them, especially
that from Caburn, fig. 41<span class="smc">B</span>, and sickle shape,
corresponds with remarkable accuracy to the description of a Greek key
given by <span class="sc">Eustathius</span>, and quoted in <span
class="sc">Parkhurst's</span> 'Hebrew Lexicon.' He says that they were
"in the shape of a sickle, and that not being easily carried in the hand
on account of their inconvenient form they were carried on the shoulder,
as we see our reapers carry on their shoulders at this day their
sickles, joined and tied together." <span class="sc">Callimachus</span>,
in his hymn to <span class="sc">Ceres</span>, says that the goddess,
having assumed the form of <span class="sc">Nicippe</span>, her priests
carried a key, κατωμαδιος, that is, fit to be borne on the shoulder.<a href="#note16" name="noteref16"><small>[16]</small></a>
This also explains, I presume, the passage in Isaiah, "and the key of
the House of <span class="sc">David</span> <i>will I lay upon his
shoulder</i>; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut,
and none shall open."<a href="#note17" name="noteref17"><small>[17]</small></a> It will be seen that the specimen found by me
in Mount Caburn corresponds exactly with the description given in the
above quotations, the curved portion of the key being 7&#188; inches in
diameter, a bundle of them tied together would exactly fit the shoulder,
as represented in fig. 43<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate IV. As we
know from the researches of Mr. <span class="sc">Evans</span> and others
that imitations of the coins of Greece spread throughout Gaul and
Britain, some of which, of very debased form and cast in tin, were found
in the camp at Caburn in association with the sickle-shaped keys, and
others have been found in connection with relics of the same period
elsewhere, there is no inherent improbability in the supposition that
the keys may have followed a like route.<a href="#note18" name="noteref18"><small>[18]</small></a> Should further discoveries
tend to confirm this connection, it would be a remarkable testimony to
the value of archæological investigation if the well-known passage
in the 'Odyssey' about the key of <span class="sc">Penelope</span> were
to find its definite interpretation on the shores of Sussex.<a href="#note19" name="noteref19"><small>[19]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
We must now return to fig. 2, Plate I., in order to trace the third
class, C, of locks and padlocks fastening with a spring catch. It seems
probable that fixed locks may have preceded hanging ones, although, on
the other hand, the want of some contrivance for securing property must
have been felt in connection with saddle-bags, panniers, and other
appliances of nomadic life, and in a condition of society which
preceded the use of fixed abodes. Be this as it may, it seems possible
to trace the employment of spring locks by means of survivals from the
common door-bolt.
</p>

<p>
The origin of the spring padlock, in the present state of my knowledge
on the subject, is doubtful. The sequence which I here assume is only
tentative, and it is probable that connecting links with more primitive
contrivances may be supplied hereafter. The defect of the common bolt,
as I have already shown, was its insecurity as an outside fastening; in
fact it afforded no security at all, and to remedy this defect and make
it inaccessible, except by means of a key, several different
contrivances appear from the first to have suggested themselves; amongst
others, one of the simplest was adopted in connection with the
Scandinavian bolt, a specimen of which, probably a modern survival of an
ancient form, was exhibited in the Scandinavian Section of the
Exhibition of 1867, and is figured in <span class="sc">M. Liger's</span>
work.<a href="#note20" name="noteref20"><small>[20]</small></a> We must suppose the handle in fig. 2, Plate I., and its neck
connecting it with the bolt, to be removed, leaving only the slit in the
door along which the neck of the handle slid, and that a similar slit
was made in the bolt also. The key, which was of iron, was T-shaped; it
was inserted from the outside through the slit in the door, and in the
bolt, with the arms of the T in a horizontal plane; it then received a
quarter turn so that the arms of the T were brought into a vertical
plane, and it was then pulled back, when the returns of the T were made
to fit into two holes provided for them on either side of the slit in
the bolt, on the inside, figs. 1<span class="smc">C</span> and 2<span
class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV. By this means the key obtained a grip of
the bolt, and it was only necessary to press it to one side in order to
shoot it. This bolt, which is taken from <span class="sc">M.
Liger's</span> work, so closely resembles the next one to be described,
that if he had been a less careful writer one might suppose that it was
the same lock, and that he had omitted to represent the spring which
alone constitutes the improvement shown in figs. 3<span
class="smc">C</span>, 4<span class="smc">C</span>, and 5<span
class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., which was presented to me by Dr. <span
class="sc">Engelhardt</span>, at Copenhagen. It is still in use on barn
and outhouse doors in Norway, and was first brought to notice by
Professor <span class="sc">O. Rygh</span>, of Christiania. The key,
which is of the same form as the last, enters the slit in the same
manner, and after receiving the quarter turn is pressed home into the
holes on the inside surface of the bolt like the last. In so doing, when
firmly pulled back, it presses down a straight flat steel spring, the
fixed end of which is attached to the door between it and the bolt, and
the free end of which, when released, catches in a notch in the bolt so
as to keep it securely in its place when shut. When the free end of this
spring is pressed down by the returns of the key, it clears the edges of
the notch, and the bolt can then be drawn back by pressing the key
sideways. Both these specimens are therefore key-drawn as in Class B.
Assuming this modern Norwegian lock to be a survival of an ancient form,
one might naturally expect that the wooden portions of the ancient locks
would have perished. The springs, which are the only metallic portions
of this lock, would certainly become detached from the wood; their uses,
when discovered separately, would not be recognised, and nothing to
identify the mechanism with a door fastening would remain but the iron
keys.
</p>

<p>
We must therefore judge of the distribution of this class of lock by
the localities in which keys of this form are found. They are of two
kinds, one T-shaped as in the preceding examples, and the other,
serving the same purpose, but having the two teeth on one side of the
shank; both are found together mainly in northern countries, which have
been subject to Scandinavian influence. Notwithstanding which, however,
the evidence is insufficient to establish the fact of their being of
Scandinavian origin. They appear certainly to have been used in Roman
times in England and elsewhere, and the influence of southern
civilization upon the Scandinavian arts of the iron age is well
established. It is always necessary to be on one's guard against
inferring that forms originated of necessity in the regions in which
they are most widely distributed, for, as we have seen, and have reason
to believe, the wooden Scotch lock was carried to the West Indies and
used by negroes on account of the facility with which it was
constructed and the materials of which it was composed, so in all ages
the more simple forms of contrivances must have found acceptance and
survived longer on the outskirts of civilization than in those
countries in which they were quickly superseded by new improvements.
</p>

<p>
Figs. 6<span class="smc">C</span>, and 7<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., are iron keys of these
two kinds obtained by me at Clermont-Ferrand, in Auvergne, France.
Figs. 8<span class="smc">C</span>, and 9<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., are two similar
specimens from Colchester, which are figured in <span class="sc">Wright's</span>
'Uriconium,' where he supposes them to be latch keys, and he says that
two similar ones were found at Wroxeter.<a href="#note21" name="noteref21"><small>[21]</small></a> Fig. 10<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate
IV., another in my collection from Jordan Hill, near Weymouth. Fig.
11<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., was discovered in a Roman building at
Caudebec-les-Elbeuf, by the Abb&#233; <span class="sc">Cochet</span>, in 1864,<a href="#note22" name="noteref22"><small>[22]</small></a> together
with an iron lock plate, fig. 12<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., showing the slit
through which the key entered, and which is similar to the modern
Scandinavian specimen above described. Figs. 13<span class="smc">C</span>, and
14<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., are two similar specimens discovered in a
Roman villa at Hartlip, in Kent, and are taken from <span class="sc">Roach
Smith's</span> 'Collectanea.'<a href="#note23" name="noteref23"><small>[23]</small></a> Figs. 15<span class="smc">C</span>, 16<span class="smc">C</span>, and
17<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., are similar keys found in Anglo-Saxon graves
at Sarr, in Kent, where the presence of these keys on the left side of
the skeleton usually denoted a female grave.<a href="#note24" name="noteref24"><small>[24]</small></a> A similar occurrence of
keys in the graves of females has been noticed in the Island of Bj&#246;rk&#246;.
According to an old Scandinavian custom they were the badges of the
lady of the house, who was said to be married to lock and keys, and
from certain law texts of the Middle Ages, it appears that two of them
were suspended from the girdle.<a href="#note25" name="noteref25"><small>[25]</small></a> Keys of this shape of both bronze
and iron were found at Sarr, corroded together. It is worthy of remark
that in these Saxon graves some fragments of Roman pottery were found,
pointing to the influence of the earlier Roman period. Fig.
18<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., is a bronze key from Gotland, and is taken
from Mr. <span class="sc">Montelius's</span> 'Antiquit&#233;s Su&#233;doises,'<a href="#note26" name="noteref26"><small>[26]</small></a> where it is
described as being of the late iron age, perhaps as late as the 10th
century. Figs. 19<span class="smc">C</span>, and 20<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV., are from
Bj&#246;rk&#246;, in the Gulf of Bothnia, found in association with relics of the
8th century of our era.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the lock which has been described in the preceding
paragraph was the origin of the spring padlock, constructed entirely of
metal, may perhaps be doubtful; but it is evident that the principle of
its construction was the same. In both systems the bolt was secured by
the end of a spring catch. It is only necessary to transfer the fixed
end of the spring from the door to the bolt, and the notch from the
bolt to the door, to make it resemble the spring catch of the Roman
padlock about to be described.
</p>

<p>
The Roman iron padlock and key represented in figs. 21<span class="smc">C</span> to
22<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., which is put together from specimens in my
collection obtained partly from Jordan Hill, near Weymouth, and other
sources, consisted of a square box, having a bar, <i>d</i>, on the top,
and parallel to it, which was attached to one end of the box by means
of a curved portion. The bolt <i>a</i> was provided with two
perpendicular bars, <i>b b</i>, at the end of which were rings, <i>c
c</i>, which slipped on to the parallel bar <i>d</i>. At the end of the
bolt were two or more catch springs, <i>e</i>, put on like the barbs of
an arrow. These, being placed into the hole of the tube <i>f</i>, at
the same time that the rings were slipped along the bar, collapsed and
sprung open again, after having passed the opening, thereby fixing the
bolt in the tube. To open the lock, a pin or key, <i>g</i>, having a
return at the end, in which was a slit made to fit the springs, was
pressed in at the opposite end, so as to close up the springs, after
which the bolt could be drawn out of the box. This action is better
shown in the succeeding examples of modern spring locks of the same
kind. The case of a similar padlock to the above was found with Roman
remains at Irchester, near Wellingborough, Northampton, by the Rev.
<span class="sc">R. Baker</span>, in 1878, and is figured in the Associated
Architectural Society's Reports, vol. xv., plate iv., 1879.
</p>

<p>
This padlock was therefore a hand-drawn, and not a key-drawn, lock. Its
origin is at present uncertain, but it is here no doubt represented in
its more complete and developed state, after having already undergone
prior modifications. The absence of simpler contrivances of the same
kind suggests the inference that its forerunners may have been made of
perishable materials. Be that as it may, its progress onward from this
point of perfection can be traced with some degree of certainty.
Already in Roman times it had undergone changes. Amongst the Roman
antiquities discovered in 1854 by the Honourable <span class="sc">Richard
Neville</span> (since Lord <span class="sc">Braybrooke</span>), at Great Chesterford, in
Essex,<a href="#note27" name="noteref27"><small>[27]</small></a> were two kinds of this padlock: one, represented in fig.
23<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is of the form already described; the other
(figs. 24<span class="smc">C</span> and 25<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V.) was constructed on
what, judging by those which succeeded it, must probably have been
regarded as an improved form, or it may have been merely adapted to a
different purpose. The bolt <i>a</i>, instead of having perpendicular
bars and rings to slip over the parallel bar, was simply a plain
straight bolt with the catch springs attached to it. The horizontal
parallel bar of the lock, after passing along the top of the box or
tube, was curved down over the mouth of the lock, at a short distance
from it, and terminated in a ring, leaving a space between it and the
mouth of the tube to admit of the passage of the chain or staple, or
whatever was intended to be secured by means of the padlock, as shown
in fig. 25<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V. The bolt was slipped through this ring,
and on into the tube, the barbed springs flying out and catching after
they entered the box, so as to fill up this space and secure the bolt,
which was opened and withdrawn in the same manner as before, as shown
in fig. 24<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V.
</p>

<p>
A further modification of this takes place in the Swedish padlock,
figs. 26<span class="smc">C</span> and 27<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., in which the parallel
bar <i>d</i>, instead of being a fixture, is made to turn upon a hinge
at <i>h</i>. When shut, the other end of the bar, instead of coming
down over the mouth of the tube, and at a distance from it, as in the
preceding example of a Roman padlock, is made to enter the side of the
tube at <i>j</i>, and the bolt passes through the ring of the bar,
after entering the mouth of the lock and inside, instead of outside of
it. By this means we arrive at the ordinary hinge of the padlock which
with further modification of form and mechanism is in use on carpet
bags in this country at the present day. This Swedish spring padlock
was in use in Scandinavia until towards the end of last century. There
is one in the Museum at Kiel, which was found with iron spear-heads of
the 11th century; others are attributed to the 15th century in that
country. Figs. 31<span class="smc">C</span> and 32<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is a specimen
of an English fetterlock of the same construction as the Swedish one,
obtained at Epping, near London, and we have evidence that a lock
constructed on this principle continued in use throughout the Middle
Ages. In 1829 a fragment of an iron padlock, consisting of the tube or
box with its parallel bar attached to it, was found in association with
some extended skeletons at Lagore, near Dunshaughlin, in the county of
Meath, in Ireland. It is figured in the sixth volume of the
'Archæological Journal,' where it is described as an iron pipe, its use
being apparently unknown to the writer. It was found in connection with
iron leaf-shaped spear heads, broad double-edged swords, bronze pins,
and enamelled ornaments, and the post-Roman period of the find is
attested by the presence of the fallow deer amongst the associated
animal remains. Figs. 28<span class="smc">C</span>, 29<span class="smc">C</span>, 30<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate
V., is a Russian bronze padlock, believed to date between the 1st and
4th centuries, greatly resembling the Oriental ones to be hereafter
described. It is in the Museum of St. Petersburg, and is copied from
<span class="sc">M. Liger's</span> work. Fig. 33<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is a fragment of
one containing the springs and curved bar, found by me in excavations
made in the Norman Camp at Folkestone. It was discovered in the body of
the rampart, and in a position to prove that it was of the age of the
construction of the camp, or of the period of its early occupation.<a href="#note28" name="noteref28"><small>[28]</small></a>
Fig. 34<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is a later example very much resembling
the Russian padlock, fig. 29<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., and of the same kind
as the last. The curved bar of the bolt fits into a socket in the
parallel bar, in which respect it resembles some of the Indian ones to
be hereafter described. It was found at Swanscombe, in Kent, and is
probably of the 15th century. It is extracted from the 'Archæological
Journal.'<a href="#note29" name="noteref29"><small>[29]</small></a> Part of a padlock similar to this was lately found by Mr.
<span class="sc">James Wilson</span> in the ditch of Bedford Castle, and was exhibited
at the Society of Antiquaries. Another similar one was found near
Devizes, and is figured in Dean <span class="sc">Merewether's</span> 'Diary of a
Dean,' fig. 18. Both of these last, like the Russian bronze one,
represented in fig. 29<span class="smc">C</span>, are ornamented on the outside of the
case with lines of zigzags, resembling Norman tracery; and coupled with
the precise resemblance in the construction of the locks, this
ornamentation appears to prove an eastern connection during the first
four centuries of our era. The fetterlock figures as the badge of the
family of the <span class="sc">Longs</span> of Wraxall, dating from the 15th century,
and it is at the present time the badge of the 14th Company of the
Grenadier Guards, an illustration of which is given in the accompanying
woodcut. It was one of the badges assumed by <span class="sc">Edward IV.</span>, and
an account of it is given in Sir <span class="sc">F. Hamilton's</span> history of that
Regiment.<a href="#note30" name="noteref30"><small>[30]</small></a>

All the spring padlocks hitherto described have the defect of being in
two parts; the bolt, being entirely detached from the tube when open,
was liable to be lost, and to remedy this defect, modifications were
introduced by which the bolt became a fixture in the tube and was
opened by means of a key.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 35<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is a lock which I found attached to one of
my gates at Rushmore, in South Wilts. Externally, it exactly resembles
the spring fetterlock, but within, the bolt which fixes the
semicircular bar in its position when locked, is retained there by a
spiral spring. To unlock it, a key with a female screw is put in at the
end in the same position as the key of the Roman lock, and after
seizing the male screw within, the bolt is screwed back against the
spring, thereby releasing the semicircular bar or staple, which is then
turned upon its hinge and drawn out of the opening on the side of the
tube.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 36<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is a precisely similar lock from Paris.
Fig. 37<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is another from Germany. Our modern
handcuffs retain the form of the fetterlock, having the tubular case
for the lock, which otherwise is not precisely the form most suitable
to fit the human wrist. Fig. 38<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., is a section of an
old handcuff obtained in Wiltshire, the bolt of which is forced out of
the eye, not by means of a screw, but by a key of the ordinary form of
a door key, inserted in the side of the tube, which when turned forces
the bolt back against the spiral spring and releases the semicircular
bar.
</p>

<p>
Whilst in some of the more modern contrivances the external form of the
Roman spring padlock was retained, the interior mechanism having
undergone changes, in others the interior mechanism is retained, the
external form having adapted itself to the more modern uses. Figs.
39<span class="smc">C</span>, 40<span class="smc">C</span>, and 41<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., is an old
padlock which I obtained in Paris, the date of which I have been unable
to determine, but a precisely similar one is attached to the iron chest
of the Royal Society, which was presented to the Society in the year
1665, and for the knowledge of which I am indebted to Dr. <span class="sc">John
Evans</span>, F.R.S., the Treasurer of the Society. Externally it
resembles the modern padlock, but both ends of the semicircular staple
are provided with springs on the principle of the Roman padlock. It is
opened by means of a revolving key of modern form, which is inserted
into the side of the padlock, and which, when given a quarter turn
presses back the three springs upon the bolts, and the staple is then
withdrawn bodily from the body of the lock. In this case, the staple,
being quite separate from the lock, would be liable to be lost, as with
the spring of the Roman padlock; so to remedy this defect we see in
figs. 42<span class="smc">C</span> and 43<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., obtained at
Clermont-Ferrand, in Auvergne, an improvement in which one of the arms
of the staple passes down through the padlock and out at the bottom of
it, where it terminates in a button, intended to prevent its being
drawn entirely out and separated from the lock. The other arm is
furnished with a spring as in the last example and, like it, is opened
by a revolving key. When the spring is pressed back it is drawn out and
merely turned upon its longer arm as a pivot.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point I have endeavoured to trace the gradual development of
the European padlock from the earliest contrivance of Roman times up to
the present time. In order to show its distribution and the varieties
it has undergone in other parts of the world we must now return to the
spring padlock in its earliest form. Figs. 44<span class="smc">C</span>, 45<span class="smc">C</span>,
and 46<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., represents an iron padlock from the Gate
of Moultan, in India, now in the India Museum. It is in all respects
similar to the Roman lock shown in figs. 21<span class="smc">C</span> to 23<span class="smc">C</span>,
Plate V., and needs no further description. Figs. 47<span class="smc">C</span> and
48<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., is a padlock obtained by me of a vendor of old
iron in the streets of Cairo in 1881. It is constructed on precisely
the same principle as the last, and is opened by a key thrust in
longitudinally at the end of the tube, like the Roman key, but the
opposite end of the bolt instead of being guided by a ring slipping
along the parallel bar of the lock is curved round and inserted into a
tube or socket in the parallel bar, like the Russian specimen and that
from Swanscombe, in Kent. Figs. 49<span class="smc">C</span> and 50<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate
VI., is another specimen obtained by me at Cairo; it also resembles the
Roman lock in its construction, except that the key instead of being
thrust in at the end of the tube is put in underneath at right angles
to the tube, and having enclosed the springs by means of an opening cut
in the side of the key, in order to compress them, it is thrust
sideways along the tube, the neck being guided by a slit along the
bottom of the tube. Figs. 51<span class="smc">C</span> and 52<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI.,
shows another specimen in my possession from India, which so precisely
resembles the last that one is tempted to suppose they must both have
been made in the same place, were it not for certain peculiarities
which identify it as Indian. The key in closing on the springs is
guided by two slits along the bottom of the tube instead of one, and
beneath the tube is a projecting piece in the form of a Greek cross
which fits into corresponding slits in the key so that none but the
proper key can pass by it to compress the springs. This contrivance is
therefore of the nature of a ward. Figs. 53<span class="smc">C</span>, 54<span class="smc">C</span>,
and 55<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., is another from India, now in the India
Museum, the locality of which, viz., Myhere, is attached to it. Figs.
56<span class="smc">C</span> and 57<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., is an Egyptian manacle in my
collection fastened in the same manner. Figs. 58<span class="smc">C</span>,
59<span class="smc">C</span>, and 60<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VII., is a similar lock from
Abyssinia, now in the British Museum, affording additional evidence
that the key, with the lateral movement inserted at right angles to the
lock, is African as well as Indian. Two padlocks precisely similar to
this are in my collection from Mogadore, on the West Coast of Africa,
having on them the peculiar Moorish ornamentation in brass which is
characteristic of that country.
</p>

<p>
We have now to go to China for evidence of the continued distribution
eastwards of this particular kind of spring padlock with the lateral
key. Figs. 61<span class="smc">C</span>, 62<span class="smc">C</span>, and 63<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VII., is
a brass Chinese padlock and key in my collection. To the north of India
we have figs. 64<span class="smc">C</span>, 65<span class="smc">C</span>, 66<span class="smc">C</span>, 67<span class="smc">C</span>,
Plate VII., representing a padlock from Yarkand obtained by Sir
<span class="sc">Douglas Forsyth</span>, and now in the India Museum. It has also the
key with the lateral action. Mr. <span class="sc">Thomas Wright</span> says that he
possesses a similar padlock, given him by the British Vice-Consul at
Jacmel, and obtained from Hayti, which he says was probably a century
old, and either made in one of the Spanish colonies or imported from
Spain.<a href="#note31" name="noteref31"><small>[31]</small></a> Sir <span class="sc">Gardner Wilkinson</span> also mentions one from Meroe
Island, in Egypt,<a href="#note32" name="noteref32"><small>[32]</small></a> and Mr. <span class="sc">H. Syer Cuming</span> speaks of one as
having been obtained in Western Africa, but the locality is not
stated.<a href="#note33" name="noteref33"><small>[33]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In order to show the modifications that this lock has undergone during
its eastern migrations, I have represented (figs. 68<span class="smc">C</span>,
69<span class="smc">C</span>, and 70<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VII.) a steel lock from Indore,
India. It is furnished with a staple with two arms like the European
specimen, fig. 39<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., one of which only has springs
attached to it; it is now in the India Museum. Figs. 71<span class="smc">C</span>,
72<span class="smc">C</span>, 73<span class="smc">C</span>, 74<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VII.&#8212;also in the India
Museum: the bolt with its springs is attached to plates forming an
outside casing to one side of the lock, by which means the opening is
concealed, and the opening for the key is also concealed in a casing
for the other side, and opens also with a catch spring released by the
pressure of a straight pin or wire introduced through a hole beneath
the lock. Figs. 75<span class="smc">C</span>, 76<span class="smc">C</span>, and 77<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate
VIII., is another variety, from Burmah; the key is introduced at the
end of the tube by means of a male screw, formed somewhat like the
propeller of a screw steamship. This screw is merely for the purpose of
introducing the key into the tube by a half-twist; once in, it is
pressed straight forward, and compresses the springs in the usual
manner. Fig. 78<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VIII., is the opening and key of a
similar lock obtained by me in Nuremberg. It is constructed precisely
on the same principle as the last, and with a similar object; it has
all the appearance of being European, but I have no certain evidence
that it may not have been imported from India. In figs. 79<span class="smc">C</span>,
80<span class="smc">C</span>, and 81<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VIII., from Indore, India, we see
the screw principle developed. Whether this originated in a lock of the
last-mentioned form&#8212;and the screw, from having at first been used as a
ward, was ultimately employed to release the bolt by a screw motion&#8212;I
know not; but it exactly resembles in its construction the lock shown
in fig. 35<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., from the gate at Rushmore, Wilts, and
those of like form from France and Germany already figured and
described. The bolt is retained in its place when locked by a spiral
spring, and withdrawn by a screw key inserted at the end. Whether this
is an independent growth in the two hemispheres, or copied the one from
the other, I have no present means of determining. Unfortunately, when
the objects in the India Museum at South Kensington were transferred
from the old India Museum their history was lost; but I have figured
none except those which have the localities attached to them. Figs.
82<span class="smc">C</span>, 83<span class="smc">C</span>, and 84<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VIII., is a steel
lock from India of similar external form to fig. 71<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate
VII.; but the screw principle appears here to have entirely superseded
the spring, which is altogether wanting, and it is dependent for its
action entirely on a screw key inserted at the end, and by means of
which the bolt (which itself formed the staple) is screwed up or
screwed back again as required. As a parallel to this, the specimen in
my collection represented in figs. 85<span class="smc">C</span>, 86<span class="smc">C</span>,
87<span class="smc">C</span>, 88<span class="smc">C</span>, and 89<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VIII., may be
given. It was obtained by me in Brussels, and resembles the tubular
lock only in external form. The staple is secured to the tube at each
end by eyes let into the side of the tube, through which a pin is
passed, and screwed up or unscrewed by a key put in at the end of the
tube. When unscrewed the pin is withdrawn and the staple taken out
bodily. In this, as in the Indian specimen last described, the original
spring mechanism has entirely disappeared; but, although resembling
each other in this respect, there is nothing analogous in the two
systems, which, from differences in the details of their construction,
appear to be quite independent contrivances. Figs. 90<span class="smc">C</span>,
91<span class="smc">C</span>, and 92<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VIII., represent a padlock and
key from Toomkoor, Mysore, India. It is a barbed spring padlock of the
ordinary kind, but the springs are closed preparatory to being
withdrawn by means of a common revolving key inserted in the side and
having a broad slit in the middle of the revolving plate. By giving the
key a quarter-turn the slit in the key-plate compresses the springs,
and they are then withdrawn from the lock. The action of the key in
this specimen resembles exactly that of the padlock from Paris (fig.
39<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI.) and that of the Royal Society chest, except
that in the Paris and Royal Society specimens two springs are
compressed by means of a solid plate, whilst in the Toomkoor example a
single-barbed spring is compressed by the action of a slit in the key.
Barbed tubular spring locks of precisely the same form as the Chinese
ones are also used in Japan, of which figs. 93<span class="smc">C</span>, 94<span class="smc">C</span>,
95<span class="smc">C</span>, and 96<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX., represent a specimen in my
collection. Of these, some of the keys entered at the end of the tube;
others are put in at the side, as shown in fig. 97<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX.
The key, which, like the lock, is of brass, is placed in a handle,
which shuts up like the handle of a knife (as shown in fig.
96<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX.) for convenience of transport. Another specimen
from Japan (represented in figs. 98<span class="smc">C</span> and 99<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate
IX.) resembles exactly the Toomkoor specimen from India, the springs
being compressed by means of a revolving key. This must certainly be
regarded as the first stage of improvement upon the original Roman
lock, and its employment in Europe, India, and Japan is noteworthy.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the specimens of these tubular spring locks, which appear to
show evidence of connection over wide areas, are those which are
constructed in the forms of animals. Figs. 100<span class="smc">C</span> and
101<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX., is a representation of a bronze padlock in
the form of a fish, now in the Louvre, at Paris, figured by <span class="sc">M.
Liger</span>. It is there described, though not without hesitation, as an
Egyptian lock; if so, it is probably of the Romano-Egyptian period: the
springs enter at the mouth of the fish, and are released by a key put
in at the tail. Figs. 102<span class="smc">C</span>, 103<span class="smc">C</span>, 104<span class="smc">C</span>,
Plate IX., represents a precisely similar fish-shaped padlock of iron
from India, and now in the India Museum. Figs. 105<span class="smc">C</span> and
106<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX., is a Roman bronze lock in the form of a lion
or horse, in the possession of Dr. <span class="sc">John Evans</span>, F.R.S., and
here copied by his permission; a similar one is in the British Museum.
Figs. 107<span class="smc">C</span>, 108<span class="smc">C</span>, and 109<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX., is
another, also in the form of a lion, and about the same size, from
China, in the collection of Mr. <span class="sc">Chubb</span>, the well-known
locksmith. In all these the springs enter at the stern of the animal,
and the other end of the bolt turns up and back in the form of a tail,
and enters the neck of the animal behind the head. The key in the
Chinese specimen has a peculiar secret contrivance to prevent its being
inserted in the hole for it by anyone not acquainted with its
construction. The head of the key will not enter the keyhole unless the
handle end is put in first and slipped along the shank of the key, as
represented in the drawing, fig. 109<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX. Mr.
<span class="sc">Romilly Allen</span>, whose work on Scotch wooden tumbler locks I
have already quoted, refers incidentally in his paper to spring locks,
and says that he has himself seen them used in Persia in the forms of
animals. We are thus led to infer that the practice of making them in
these forms may have existed, or may still exist, continuously
throughout the region referred to, and that, like the mechanism itself,
and like many other articles of commerce, they may have passed by
traffic from place to place, and been copied and adopted in the
localities in which they are found. Fig. 110<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IX., is a
padlock obtained by me at Cairo; similar ones are in common use on
out-houses at Naples, the long bar at the top denoting its descent from
the Roman padlock, although the construction of the lock is different.
</p>

<p>
We now come to the principle of the revolving key in common use at the
present time. It has been already shown that in using the Roman lock
(figs. 15<span class="smc">B</span> to 20<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate III.) the part of the key
containing the pins had to be put in vertically, and then turned a
quarter circle, so as to bring the teeth horizontally beneath the
tumblers previously to lifting them. It is possible that this may have
suggested the first idea of employing the twist thus given to the key
to the shooting of the bolt. Fig. III, Plate IX., taken from <span class="sc">M.
Liger's</span> work,<a href="#note34" name="noteref34"><small>[34]</small></a> represents a Roman key found in London; it has a
plate furnished with teeth, evidently intended to raise tumblers, and
the stem of the key is piped for the purpose of fitting into a broach
or pin, so that the plate with the teeth, when the key is turned round
on its pivot, may fit into its proper place beneath the bolt and raise
up the tumblers. Fig. 112, Plate IX., is a drawing of another key
similarly formed, having two teeth and a piped stem; it was found in
Lothbury, in London, 16 feet beneath the surface, and is figured in Mr.
<span class="sc">Syer Cuming's</span> paper on keys in the 'Journal of the
Archæological Association.'<a href="#note35" name="noteref35"><small>[35]</small></a> These keys appear hardly to admit of any
doubt as to their mode of use, and may therefore be regarded as the
earliest specimen of revolving keys, although applied to a different
purpose from the revolving key of our own time. The most primitive kind
of lock with a revolving key that I have met with is one represented in
figs. 113, 114, 115, 116, Plate X. It is from India, and is in the
India Museum. The key is applied to a square vertical tumbler of the
Scandinavian type with two arms to fit into two notches in the bolt;
the lower end of the tumbler terminates behind the bolt, in a
semicircular form; the key, when turned upon its broach or pin, as the
case may be, impinges upon the sides of the semicircular portion and
raises the tumbler out of the notches on the top of the bolt, and
afterwards the end of the key-plate passes into one of a series of
notches on the under side of the bolt and moves it, whilst the tumbler
is, at the same time, raised clear of the bolt. The key being turned
several times continues the movement, pushing the key forward notch
after notch, until the tumbler again falls into other holes provided
for it, and keeps the bolt secure. All here is of wood, except the key,
which is of metal, and it is provided with slits to pass the wards,
adjusted to them in the revolution of the key-plate upon its pivot. It
might be supposed from this that it was a modern adaptation to an
ancient system of vertical tumblers, had not a very similar, but
simpler, lock existed in China. The drawing (figs. 117, 118, 119, 120,
121, Plate X.) of a Chinese lock was kindly sent me by Mr. <span class="sc">Romilly
Allen</span>. In this specimen the bolt is shot in nearly the same manner
as the last specimen, but the tumblers are raised independently by
means of a T-shaped key (fig. 121, Plate X.), similar to that used with
the Scandinavian lock (fig. 3<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate IV.). The key from the
outside is put into the vertical slit between the tumblers, when it is
turned a quarter circle so as to bring the arms of the T in a
horizontal plane. It is then pressed back, when the returns of the T
enter notches provided for them in the tumblers. The tumblers are then
raised, and the key or handle, <i>a</i>, turned. From the inside the
tumblers are raised with the two fingers before shooting the bolt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">M. Liger</span> supposes that the lifting key of the Roman lock was
of Asiatic origin, and that the revolving key came into use amongst the
Romans about the commencement<a href="#note36" name="noteref36"><small>[36]</small></a> of our era, and many of the keys from
Pompeii are constructed on this principle having slits for the passage
of wards. Fig. 122, Plate X., is a Roman key of this kind in my
collection. The ward system came into general use afterwards and was
much relied upon to the exclusion of others in the Middle Ages. The
ward system may be defined as a system of lock in which obstructions
are placed to prevent any but the proper key from entering to turn the
bolt; as such it is distinct from the tumbler system, in which security
depends on obstruction introduced to prevent the bolt from being drawn
by the key. The tumbler is, in fact, a bolt of a bolt. Reference to
fig. 10<span class="smc">B</span>, Plate II., representing the Egyptian lock, will show
that besides the two pins with which the key is provided for lifting
the tumblers, there is a pin attached to the under side of the lock
opening, which enters a hole in the key. This is of the nature of a
ward, since none but a key with a hole in the proper place could be
raised up high enough to lift the tumblers clear of the holes in the
bolt. Mr. <span class="sc">Romilly Allen</span> also mentions that in one of the
Scotch locks from Snizort, a notch is placed in the key and a
corresponding pin in the lock, to prevent the lock from being picked,
and that the key-hole is divided by a thin iron plate which is the only
thing approaching a ward that appears in any of the wooden locks of
Scotland. The peculiar shape of the tumblers and tumbler-holes in the
bolts of the Roman lock, already described, with teeth made especially
to fit them, must be regarded as a kind of ward, although applied to
tumblers, since their object is to prevent any but the proper form of
key from entering.
</p>

<p>
The further development of the ward-system in the Roman tumbler-locks,
though it certainly existed, is involved in uncertainty, since none of
the wards appear to have been preserved, but the fact of some kind of
ward having been used is evident from the slits in the keys represented
in fig. 122, Plate X., which are of common occurrence. The cross-shaped
wards beneath the Indian spring padlock already described in connection
with figs. 53<span class="smc">C</span>, 54<span class="smc">C</span>, and 55<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI.,
must certainly be considered to be wards, although open to view, and
not concealed beneath the lock-plate. There are also found in
association with Roman remains, keys of which fig. 123, Plate X., from
Chalons, fig. 124, Plate X., from the Museum at Saumur, and fig. 125,
Plate X., from the Museum at Saint Germain, are examples.<a href="#note37" name="noteref37"><small>[37]</small></a> These keys
so greatly resemble the Asiatic keys used with the spring padlock, that
it is difficult to believe they were not employed in the same way, but
as they also resemble the Roman perforated plates of the tumbler-lock
keys that are provided with teeth, it is probable they may have been
intended for raising tumblers in some way not yet explained. No tubular
spring lock adapted to be opened with a key inserted underneath, and
opened with a lateral movement like the Indian and Egyptian ones, has
to my knowledge been found amongst Roman remains. Fig. 126, Plate X.,
is a modern English latch-key of similar form, furnished with a
ward-plate and used for raising a common latch: they are now generally
disused, from being unsafe. With the revolving keys resembling the
modern form, found at Pompeii and elsewhere, slits for fixed wards are
common, and show that the Roman keys of the commencement of the present
era resembled our own. During the Middle Ages reliance was placed
almost entirely on the ward system, and many complicated contrivances
were introduced, of which fig. 127, Plate X., is a specimen, until the
close of the last century, when their insecurity led to the
re-introduction of tumbler-locks.
</p>

<p>
It is not known exactly when this took place, but probably at some time
during the 18th century, and possibly earlier. This time, the tumblers
instead of being vertical (as was the case during what may be called
the early tumbler period) were horizontal, resting on a pivot above the
bolt and kept down by a spring. Figs. 128, 129, and 130, Plate X., is a
tumbler lock in the possession of Mr. <span class="sc">Chubb</span>, found whilst
repairing an old house at Funtley, Hants, said to be 200 years old. If
so it must be regarded as the earliest specimen of the second tumbler
period. The tumbler moves on a pivot, and is kept down by a spring, the
revolving key raises the tumbler by pressing up the curved bar attached
to it, which raises the stud of the tumbler out of the notch provided
for it on the upper side of the bolt, thereby freeing the bolt, so that
by further turning the key it is enabled to shoot the bolt. The
tumbler, it will be seen, cannot be raised too high. If the plate of
the key is long enough to raise the stud of the tumbler out of the
notch, a key with a longer plate will answer the same purpose. To
remedy this defect and necessitate the employment of a key of exactly
the proper size, Mr. <span class="sc">Barron</span>, about the year 1778, introduced
an improvement known by his name, represented in fig. 131, Plate X., in
which the bolt is provided with a slit along the middle just wide
enough to allow the stud to pass; the slit has notches both above and
below, so that if the stud is raised too high by a key with too long a
plate it is forced into the upper notch and the bolt continues
immovable. He also introduced two tumblers requiring to be raised to
different heights in order to coincide with the slit in the bolt by
means of different projections on the edge of the key plate, so that
the bolt could only be shot by means of a key with a plate expressly
constructed to fit the lock, and having two projections of the
requisite length. This principle of employing two or more tumblers is
the one on which nearly all subsequent improvements have been effected.
Those who desire to prosecute the subject further will find a variety
of modern tumbler locks in my collection introduced during the latter
half of the last and commencement of the present century. They are all,
in the main, varieties of one principle, terminating in the
<span class="sc">Chubb</span> and <span class="sc">Hobbs</span> locks of the present time. As this
paper relates only to primitive locks I do propose to describe them
here. The continuity which pervades all the ramifications of the modern
lock is not less complete than in the earlier forms, and would well
bear treating in the same manner as those which I have described. The
Bramah lock, though in external appearance differing from the others,
is no less based upon the earlier forms, and may be described as a
union between the <i>ward</i> and the <i>tumbler</i> systems. It is a
ward system, because the obstructions introduced into the mechanism are
intended to prevent the turning of the key to shoot the bolt by any but
a key of the proper construction. It is a tumbler system because the
impediments so placed upon the turning of the key are in fact tumblers
packed round the cylinder of the key (retained by springs), and
allowing the passage of the key-plate only when pressed down to the
various depths to which each separate tumbler is adapted in order to
provide an open passage for the key-plate all round. This union of
ideas developed separately in different branches of the same trade,
device or industry, corresponds to the crossing of individuals and
breeds in nature, which is so necessary to reproduction. The analogy,
as I have already intimated elsewhere, might be carried even further
and closer if space permitted. It is a necessary condition of the
absence of creative power in nature, and applies equally to all the
processes of evolution whether of species or of ideas, but the subject
requires broader treatment than can be given to it here. My object in
writing this paper being to trace the development of particular forms
rather than to generalise, I must leave the philosophy of the subject
for separate treatment.
</p>

<p>
From the foregoing description of the various kinds of primitive locks
in use in different countries it will, I think, have been made evident
that some of them most certainly have been derived from a common
centre. The wooden key-drawn pin-locks have spread over the region
extending from Egypt to Yarkand. The Scandinavian wooden locks of the
same kind, though differing in the details of their construction, we
have seen are common to Norway and Scotland, and by some means have
been carried to the West Indies and British Guiana, whilst the tubular
spring padlock of the Roman age in Europe is the same that is found
throughout the whole region extending from Italy to China and Japan on
the east, northward into England and Scandinavia, southward into
Abyssinia, and westward into West Africa and Algeria, Spain, and on as
far as the West Indies.
</p>

<p>
It is sometimes thought when simple contrivances such as weapons of
stone and bronze, some of the simpler kinds of ornaments, and of tools
obviously adapted to primeval life are found to extend over wide areas,
and in places very remote from one another, that the few ideas
necessary for the construction and use of them might easily have
suggested themselves independently in different places. To the student
of primitive culture who has become impressed with the persistency of
art forms, this independent origin of such things does not appear so
certain even in the case of the most simple contrivances. But when we
come to a complex piece of mechanism, such as a spring padlock having
several parts&#8212;the spring, the case, the parallel bar, and the key, in
all of which the resemblance is maintained in distant countries, and
which, with slight modification and continuously progressive
improvements, are put together in the same manner in all parts of the
world&#8212;such a supposition cannot be admitted, the necessity for a
common origin is apparent, and the study of the periods and the
circumstances connected with the distribution of it cannot be set aside
as superfluous.
</p>

<p>
Assuming that the tumbler pin-lock and the spring padlock cannot be
traced back earlier in Europe than the commencement of our era, it is
by no means certain that they may not have existed earlier elsewhere.
The commerce carried on with the East in early times was of a nature to
render it very probable that any contrivance for securing goods should
have spread from place to place with the merchandise exported and
imported between China, India, and Europe. A brief survey of the trade
relations between different countries will be sufficient to show this.
</p>

<p>
The expedition of <span class="sc">Alexander</span> gave rise to intercourse which was
kept up by the Greek kingdom of Bactria, and recent Indian discoveries
both of coins and sculptures prove more and more the great influence
which Greek art exercised in India up to the commencement of our era.
<span class="sc">Strabo</span> says that, about <span class="smc">B.C.</span> 22, <span class="sc">Nicolaus
Damascenus</span> fell in with three Indian ambassadors at Antioch
Epidaphne on their way to the Court of <span class="sc">Augustus</span>, and that
their credentials were in the Greek language. <span class="sc">Diodorus</span> quoting
<span class="sc">Iambulus</span> speaks of King <span class="sc">Palibothra</span> in the early part
of the 1st century as a lover of the Greeks. <span class="sc">Dio Chrysostom</span>
mentions that the poems of <span class="sc">Homer</span> were sung by the Indians, and
<span class="sc">&#198;lian</span> says that not only the Indians but the kings of Persia
translated and sang them. If the travels of <span class="sc">Apollonius</span> and
<span class="sc">Damis</span> are to be credited, the Greek language was spoken in the
Punjaub in the first half-century of our era, and frequent intercourse
appears to have taken place between that country and Egypt.<a href="#note38" name="noteref38"><small>[38]</small></a>
<span class="sc">Pliny</span> in the 1st century <span class="smc">A.D.</span> says, on the authority
of <span class="sc">Varro</span>, that under the direction of <span class="sc">Pompey</span> it was
ascertained that it took seven days to go from India to the River
Icarus, believed to be the modern Roscha, in the country of the Bactri,
which discharges itself into the Oxus, and that the merchandise of
India being conveyed from it through the Caspian Sea into the Cyrus,
might be brought by land to Phasis in Pontus in five days at most.<a href="#note39" name="noteref39"><small>[39]</small></a>
The best steel used in Rome was imported from China.<a href="#note40" name="noteref40"><small>[40]</small></a>
<span class="sc">Arrian</span>, in the 2nd century <span class="smc">A.D.</span>, speaks of a
frequented way, λεωϕóρος, extending in the direction of
India through Bactria; after which four embassies from the East are
noticed by ancient writers, one to <span class="sc">Trajan</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 107;
another to <span class="sc">Antoninus Pius</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 138-161; a third to
<span class="sc">Julian</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 361; and the fourth to
<span class="sc">Justinian</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 530. These are but scant memorials of
an intercourse which must have been frequent between India and Rome,
and which reached its highest development during the reigns of
<span class="sc">Severus</span> and <span class="sc">Caracalla</span>, in the commencement of the 3rd
century <span class="smc">A.D.</span>
</p>

<p>
Turning now to the southern route of communication with India,
<span class="sc">Pliny</span> describes Taprobane (Ceylon), and mentions an embassy
sent from thence to the Emperor <span class="sc">Claudius</span>. The discovery of the
monsoons during the 1st century was the means of creating a great trade
between India and Alexandria. <span class="sc">Strabo</span> says that in the time of
the <span class="sc">Ptolemies</span> some 20 ships only ventured upon the Indian
seas, but that this traffic had so greatly increased that he himself
saw at Myos Hormos, on the Arabian Gulf, 120 ships destined for India.
<span class="sc">Pliny</span> gives in detail the route from Alexandria to India in
his time, and says that it was well worthy of notice because in each
year India drained the empire of at least 550 sestertii, estimated at
&#163;1,400,000 of English money, giving back in exchange her own wares,
which were sold at fully one hundred times their original cost, and he
says that the voyage was made every year by the following route:&#8212;Two
miles distant from Alexandria was the town of Juliopolis, supposed to
be Nicopolis. The distance from thence to Coptos up the Nile was 308
miles, and the voyage was performed with a favourable wind in 12 days.
From Coptos the journey was made on camels to Berenice, a seaport on
the southern frontier of Egypt, 257 miles, in another 12 days. Here the
passengers generally set sail at midsummer, and in about 30 days
arrived at Ocelis, in Arabia, now called Gehla, or at Cane, supposed to
be Cava Canim Bay. From hence, if the wind called hippaulus happened to
be blowing, it was possible to arrive at Muzitis, the modern Mangalore,
which was the nearest point in India, in 40 days. This, however, was
not a convenient port for disembarking, and Barace was therefore
preferred. To this place pepper was carried down in dug-out canoes made
out of a single trunk from Cottonara, supposed to be Cochin or
Travancore. The return voyage was usually made in January, taking
advantage of the south-east monsoon, by which means they were able to
go and return the same year. But when <span class="sc">Pliny</span> wrote, the trade
with India was only in its infancy, afterwards Greek factories were
probably established at the Indian seaboards, which accounts for the
Greek names for some of the towns on that coast.
</p>

<p>
But the people of Alexandria having become insolent in their
prosperity, <span class="sc">Hadrian</span> was led to encourage the route through
Palmyra, which was the most direct road to India. Even in the 2nd
century <span class="smc">A.D.</span> the trade between Rome and India through Palmyra
must have been considerable, for it drew the attention of the Chinese.
Their annals speak of it as carried on principally by sea; they mention
Roman merchants in relations of commerce with and visiting Burmah,
Tonquin, and Cochin China, and they have preserved the memory of an
embassy from the Roman emperor, which in the year <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 166 was
received by the Chinese sovereign. Arab or native vessels appear to
have brought the produce of India up the Persian Gulf to the mouth of
the Euphrates. At Teredon they discharged their cargoes, and the
merchandise was then carried to Vologesia by camels; at this place the
merchants of Palmyra took it up and it was here exchanged for the
produce of Europe. Even as late as the 5th century, ships from India
and China are mentioned lying at Hira on the Euphrates, a little to the
south of Babylon. Through the influence of this trade Palmyra grew
rapidly into wealth and power until the widow of <span class="sc">Galberius</span>
threw off her allegiance to Rome. This led to the destruction of the
city by <span class="sc">Aurelian</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 275, which put an end to the
Roman trade with India through the Persian Gulf. The Alexandrian trade
with India fell off about the same time, and the barbarians occupied
Coptos, the port of embarkation for India, about <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 279.
</p>

<p>
After the fall of Palmyra the Indian trade was transferred to Batne,
near the Euphrates, but it lasted only a short time, and in the 4th and
5th centuries may be regarded as having become extinct in so far as
Roman merchants were concerned. The trade, however, was still kept up
by the Arabs. <span class="sc">Epiphanius</span>, about <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 375, gives an
account of trade carried on through Berenice, by which the merchants of
India imported their goods into the Roman territory, and there is also
Chinese authority for believing that a great trade between Rome and
India existed in the 6th century. <span class="sc">Ma-Touan-Lin</span>, <span class="smc">A.D.</span>
1317, in his researches into antiquity, affirms that in <span class="smc">A.D.</span>
500-516 India carried on a considerable commerce by sea with Ta-Tsin,
the Roman Empire, and with the Ansi the Syrians,<a href="#note41" name="noteref41"><small>[41]</small></a> but Arab and not
Roman vessels were employed. <span class="sc">Masoudi</span> says that in the early
part of the 7th century the Indian and Chinese trade with Babylon was
principally in the hands of the Indians and Chinese. The usual passage
after rounding the Point de Galle was to creep up the Madras coast
during the S.W. monsoon and take a point of departure from Masulapatam
towards the leading opening of the Ganges.<a href="#note42" name="noteref42"><small>[42]</small></a> Meanwhile the overland
trade between Europe and India in the 3rd and 4th centuries was carried
on by the Sassanidæ, who in the 4th century entered into commercial
relations with China, to which country they sent frequent embassies in
the 6th century, and through this route silk was imported into Europe.
In <span class="smc">A.D.</span> 712 Sind was conquered by the Arabs, and in addition
to the kingdom of Mansurah and Multan, other independent Muslim
governments were established at Bania and Kasdar.<a href="#note43" name="noteref43"><small>[43]</small></a> There is also the
evidence of the merchant <span class="sc">Sulamin</span> and the researches of Mr.
<span class="sc">Edward Thomas</span> into the coins of the Balhara to prove the
continuance of Arab intercourse with India during the 9th century.
</p>

<p>
During all this time the relations between Scandinavia and Rome appear
to have been scarcely less extensive. Although the Romans never
succeeded in penetrating Scandinavia, the discovery of coins, vases in
bronze and glass, and other objects of art, is sufficient to prove that
Scandinavian art was greatly influenced by intercourse with Rome during
the first part of the 2nd century of our era. In the early stages of
society, communication by sea offered greater facilities for traffic
than land journeys, and for this reason the Island of Gotland, now so
isolated and rarely visited except by antiquaries, appears to have
served as a portal for the entry of Roman and Oriental goods and
civilization into Scandinavia.<a href="#note44" name="noteref44"><small>[44]</small></a> After the fall of the Roman empire,
Scandinavia was left to its own resources, aided by occasional
intercourse with Byzantium, until in the later iron age, extending from
the 8th century to the middle of the 11th century, another line of
communication was established with the East, still entering Scandinavia
mainly through the Island of Gotland. Mr. <span class="sc">Hildebrand</span> records
the discovery of 20,000 Arab coins in Sweden and Gotland, and traces
the channel of their transmission by Russian finds from the states near
the Caspian, through Russia to the shores of the Baltic, and thence,
thanks to the commerce established by the inhabitants of Gotland, over
to that island. From Gotland, and probably also by direct intercourse
with Russia, the Mahomedan coins were spread over Scandinavia, being
more common in the eastern provinces of Sweden than in the west or in
Norway. The greater part of these coins appear to have come into Sweden
between the years 880 and 955, but the latest belongs to the year 1010.
On the line of communication here indicated, iron keys of the kind
adapted both to the tumbler lock and the spring padlock have been
discovered in the governments of Vladimir and Jaroslav, in the graves
of the Neriens,<a href="#note45" name="noteref45"><small>[45]</small></a> dating about the 8th century <span class="smc">A.D.</span>,
showing that in all probability it was by this line that the use of
these locks were imported into Sweden. The key of the padlock found
here was of the form of the Roman key, (fig. 21<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V.),
the Indian one (fig. 46<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI.), and the modern one
from Cairo (fig. 47<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI.). It also resembles that of
the Swedish lock (fig. 26<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V.), and belongs to the
most primitive form of the mechanism.
</p>

<p>
Whilst this traffic was being carried on between Scandinavia and the
East, the intercourse of the Vikings was kept up with Britain, Ireland,
and the coasts of the English Channel, commencing in 787 and continuing
to the 11th century. These Western relations, like those with the East,
appear to have taken place chiefly through Gotland; and the number of
Anglo-Saxon coins found in that Island and the East of Sweden greatly
exceed those discovered in Norway and the West.
</p>

<p>
The foregoing summary of the evidence of commercial relations between
Southern Europe and the East and North during the early part of the
Christian Era is sufficient to show that ample facilities existed for
the spread of early forms of locks and keys. The padlock, more
especially&#8212;which, as I have said when referring to the etymology of
the word "pad," was the class of lock associated with portable
merchandise&#8212;must have been carried into all those parts of the world
between which commercial relations had been established.
</p>

<p>
At what time and through what particular channels the various kinds of
locks were distributed can only be determined after more extended
inquiry into the archæology of padlocks. Some points may, however, I
think be considered to be more or less established by the evidence I
have adduced. The particular form of padlock represented in fig.
44<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., from India, and fig. 21<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V.,
from the Roman period of Europe, must in all probability have been
communicated in Roman times, as I am not aware that this precise form
of padlock was in use in Europe later than the Roman age, having been
superseded by the more modern improvements which have been described in
this paper. The use of padlocks in the forms of animals in Egypt,
Persia, and China, must also very probably belong to the same period.
The Chinese and Japanese padlocks appear to belong to a more advanced
stage of the development of the mechanism, and correspond to the form
used in Europe in the Middle Ages; whilst the use of the revolving key
in Europe, India, and Japan, to compress the springs, as shown in figs.
39<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VI., 90<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate VIII., and 98<span class="smc">C</span>,
Plate XI., must date from a still later phase in the art; and unless
they are to be regarded as improvements introduced independently in
those countries, the idea must have spread by means of Arab traders, if
not still more recently. In like manner, the adoption of the screw
principle with these locks must either have been conveyed by traders,
or applied independently in different countries to the form of padlock
already in use. The hinge of the staple, as seen in figs. 26<span class="smc">C</span>
and 31<span class="smc">C</span>, Plate V., though derived from the earlier form of the
parallel bar, which has a wide distribution, has not been universally
adopted, but is used chiefly in Sweden and Europe, and is an
improvement introduced, no doubt, in modern times. Further information
is needed to enable us to trace the distribution of all these different
varieties more continuously, before any satisfactory judgment can be
formed as to the date of connection. In Scandinavia we find the padlock
in use in Gotland, in Bj&#246;rk&#246;, and in Sweden; and <span class="sc">Hans
Hildebrand</span>, in his work on 'The Industrial Arts of
Scandinavia,'<a href="#note46" name="noteref46"><small>[46]</small></a> published by the South Kensington Museum, says that
they were already known in that region in Pagan times. It is to be
hoped that this announcement may be only a prelude to some more
detailed publication of his researches into a subject to which the
present paper can only be regarded as a first introduction&#8212;not
previously attempted, that I am aware of, in its ethnological and
commercial bearings. Local archæologists must work out the rest. Enough
has, I trust, been said to show that a large field lies open to the
student of the archæology of locks and keys, and that whenever the
history of this mechanism is traced in Scandinavia, Persia, India, and
China, in the same way that I have endeavoured to trace it in Europe,
much light will thereby be thrown on the ramifications of trade and the
commercial relations of distant countries in non-historic times.

formed the fastenings employed by dwellers in tents, and of which the
Gordian knot was a complicated example. In early times seals must often
have served as substitutes for locks, as we know was frequently the case
in ancient Egypt and Assyria. The wooden door must have given rise to a
totally different contrivance. It is possible, however, that something
analogous to the Japanese book fastening, represented in fig. 1, Plate
